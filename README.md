# foodApp
This is an express, JS, JQuery, Node.JS, and HTML/CSS exercise designed to allow for users to input information for a food reservation that will then be taken and parsed into JSON format and posted to a separate url. The front end will show the number the individual is listed on the wait list and their name they put down.
